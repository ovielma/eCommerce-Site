In this project we will be building a web application for a fictional e-commerce shopping cart.

The website will contain the following four sections:
* User Information
* Shopping Cart
* Shipping Information
* Checkout with Payment Information

We will be building this web application in 5 steps
1. Create the html pages for each section (described above)
2. Create an html layout and link all html pages together
3. Add JavaScript/jQuery for assisting in such things as calculations for shipping cost and total cost
4. Implement a database to store and retreive data using AJAX
5. Create a user login page and other user-focused functionalities
